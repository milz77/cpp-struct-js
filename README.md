# cpp-struct-js

The intention of this module is to interace node.js with an Arduino software I am writing. For this I need to read binary structures that are generated by C++ code running on an Arduino system.

Supported types:

* uint8,16,32
* float
* strings

One dimensional arrays are supported. Pointers are not supported, but
that wouldn't make sense anyway since serialization can't deal with
native memory adresses.

## Example

```javascript

struct = require("cpp-struct")

var player = new struct("Player", [
	"name", struct.char(12),
	"id", struct.uint32_t()
]);

var record = new struct("Record", [
	"playerIndex", struct.uint8_t(),
	"typeId", struct.uint8_t(),
	"record", struct.uint16_t(31)
]);

var EEPROMData = new struct("EEPROMData", [
	"gameName", struct.char(14),
	"version", struct.uint16_t(),
	"players", struct.type(player,player.size(),32),
	"records", struct.type(record,record.size(),32)
]);

var buffer = new Buffer(EEPROMData.size());
EEPROMData.encode(buffer,0, {
	gameName: "SuperTesting!!!",
	version: 1,
	players:[
		{name:"Hello",id:1},
		{id:2},
		{name:"HUHU"}
	]
},{endian:"LE"})

```

## Why not using one of the other modules?

I want to create schemas in node.js and use those for reading and writing binary buffers. Next to that I also want to output the header files for CPP which I can simply compile and use in my project.

The schema defines exact sizes, not the data - which may be incomplete and is to be filled with default data (zeros).

The other modules I looked at either focused on packing data as binary efficient or packed data directly without schema. 

The closest match I could find was [buffer-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer-layout).
