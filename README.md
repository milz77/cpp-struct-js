# cpp-struct-js

The intention of this module is to interace node.js with an Arduino software I am writing. For this I need to read binary structures that are generated by C++ code running on an Arduino system.

The functionality is rather limited right now, only few types are supported. 

Currently only writing works but reading is implemented soon (tm).

## Example

```javascript

struct = require("cpp-struct")

var player = new struct("Player", [
	"name", struct.char(12),
	"id", struct.uint32_t()
]);

var record = new struct("Record", [
	"playerIndex", struct.uint8_t(),
	"typeId", struct.uint8_t(),
	"record", struct.uint16_t(31)
]);

var EEPROMData = new struct("EEPROMData", [
	"gameName", struct.char(14),
	"version", struct.uint16_t(),
	"players", struct.type(player,player.size(),32),
	"records", struct.type(record,record.size(),32)
]);

var buffer = new Buffer(EEPROMData.size());
EEPROMData.encode(buffer,0, {
	gameName: "SuperTesting!!!",
	version: 1,
	players:[
		{name:"Hello",id:1},
		{id:2},
		{name:"HUHU"}
	]
},{endian:"LE"})

```
